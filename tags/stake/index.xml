      <description>Don’t want to run a node? Don’t know how? Maybe you’re a little short on STG, or don’t have the resources or availability to run a reliable node of your own? Maybe you’ve got the opposite problem, and have some STG to spare? Don’t worry, we’ve got everyone covered. Stegos staking pools are here. While community infrastructure builds up in and around the Stegos network, we’re taking the initiative to put together a number of public staking pools.</description>

      <description>At Stegos, we are committed to making things intuitive and user friendly. Our staking pools were created to make staking as accessible as possible, but KYC requirements went against this. So we got rid of them. Aggressive pruning, network sharding, and fast data messaging all prepare the Stegos network for worldwide adoption. In order to see that level of activity, our ecosystem of software and applications must be as easy to use and accessible as possible.</description>
