      <description>Dear Community, We hope you&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying the bounty and hackathon so far. Thank you for all your excellent content submissions and signal boosting of our own content.
Our community and network have both grown enormously, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to make huge efficiency improvements to our app and chain based on your feedback and bug reports.
We&amp;rsquo;ve recently translated the bounty into Chinese to reach our community. Participation has been through the roof, with a consistent flow of new members signing up.</description>
