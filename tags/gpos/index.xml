      <description>Cryptocurrency design is often focused on security, scalability and decentralization, and rightly so. But that’s not enough to build large networks which can last for the long haul. At Stegos, we know that a cryptocurrency network also needs to be fun, engaging, surprising, and rewarding. Our gamified Proof-of-Stake (gPoS) system is built with exactly these qualities in mind. Read on to learn more about what gPoS is, how it works, why a balance of risk and reward helps promote engagement and decentralization.</description>
