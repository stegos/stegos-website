      <title>Mobile Blockchain - The Holy Grail</title>

      <description>The Holy Grail
Mobile blockchain is the crypto Holy Grail. If we&amp;rsquo;re creating a global decentralized network of millions of users, we&amp;rsquo;ll want it to run on the simplest devices possible. But this has often been dismissed as too difficult, so developers either treat smartphone support as a long-term goal (which they never get to), completely neuter the capabilities of their mobile nodes, or ignore them entirely.
But that’s completely the wrong approach.</description>
