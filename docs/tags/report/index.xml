      <description>Dear Community, First of all, I&amp;rsquo;d like to apologize for the lack of updates: when you&amp;rsquo;re as serious about privacy as we are at Stegos, it can be hard to strike the right balance between secrecy and sharing! Rest assured, the whole team has been working hard behind the scenes on the Stegos chain, app, and a LOT of new marketing content, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a good enough job of keeping you, our loyal community, up to date.</description>

      <description>Stegos creates cutting-edge technology that keeps your secrets safe from prying eyes so you feel empowered and secure.
This is a third Preview release of upcoming Stegos mainnet. In order to boost node synchronization and bootstrap performance we have switched to the new pairing curve, BLS12-381, reducing BLS signature verification by the factor of 40. Another major achievement was switching single curve crypto from Curve1174 to Curve25519 in order to increase Bulletproofs performance and provide a compatibility to iOS13 CryptoKit.</description>
