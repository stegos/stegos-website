### Dear Stegos Community,

Thank you for all your testing feedback. We’re pleased to announce the release of Mainnet Beta 2.
In addition to lots of improvements and UI tweaks, the most exciting feature of Mainnet Beta 2 is Windows support. So you can now use the app on Mac, Linux or Windows.

Please visit [releases](https://github.com/stegos/stegos-wallet/releases) to download the app.

As always, please send comments, bug reports and any other feedback to <support@stegos.zendesk.com>. No comment is too small!<br>
