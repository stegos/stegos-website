# Dear Stegos Community,

We're delighted to announce the successful launch of the Stegos mainnet!

Head [here](https://github.com/stegos/stegos-wallet/releases/tag/v1.0) to download v1.0 of the Stegos destkop app and get started. Existing users should delete their testnet chain data and restart their app: it will update automatically.

## What Next?

This week we're concentrating on sending everyone their STG coins. If we need any information from you, the team will be in touch directly.

Now that the core Stegos blockchain has been developed and tested, the team are moving on to implementing the key features needed to make Stegos the number one privacy coin. We're starting by focusing on messaging, providing fully private communications for one-to-one and group chats. You'll see this in the desktop wallet first, but the aim is to have on-chain mobile messaging ready in January.

We're be making a big push to moderate and reward all the wonderful content you've submitted for the social media bounty. We'll be showcasing the best efforts over the next few weeks. We'll also be sharing instructions for how to complete KYC and claim your STG.

Our Telegram bot Jerry has been switched off, but he'll be back very soon to provide more announcements, contests, support, and sneak previews of Stegos features under development.

## STG Unlock Schedule

We're committed to a rapid unlock schedule to give everyone access to the STG they've bought and earned as soon as possible. However, we also want to respect the original sale structure, give people time to set up their wallets and ensure the blockchain isn't overloaded.

- **20th Nov:** Mainnet launch: Users can create their mainnet wallets.
- **25th Nov:** Locked tokens sent out: STG will appear in wallets but won't be transactable. Locked tokens cannot be staked.
- **2nd Dec:** Private Sale Round 2 STG unlocked
- **9th Dec:** Private Sale Round 1 STG unlocked
- **16th Dec:** Seed Investor STG unlocked
- **23rd Dec:** Remaining STG unlocked (e.g., from double token offer, bounty / hackathon, other promotions)

## And finally...

Many thanks to everyone who has supported us on our long journey to this point. We couldn't have done it without you. We hope you'll continue to support us in our quest to reject surveillance and make the world a more free and private place.
