# Dear Stegos Community,

After thousands of hours of development work, months of testing and six weeks of intense feedback and updates courtesy of our wonderful Stegos community and the bounty and hackathon, we're delighted to announce that the Stegos Mainnet will be launching on Wednesday 20th November!

## STG Unlock Schedule

We're committed to a rapid unlock schedule to give everyone access to the STG they've bought and earned as soon as possible. However, we also want to respect the original sale structure, give people time to set up their wallets and ensure the blockchain isn't overloaded.

- **20th Nov:** Mainnet launch: Users can create their mainnet wallets.
- **25th Nov:** Locked tokens sent out: STG will appear in wallets but won't be transactable. Locked tokens cannot be staked.
- **2nd Dec:** Private Sale Round 2 STG unlocked
- **9th Dec:** Private Sale Round 1 STG unlocked
- **16th Dec:** Seed Investor STG unlocked
- **23rd Dec:** Remaining STG unlocked (e.g., from double token offer, bounty / hackathon, other promotions)

## What Next?

Now that the core Stegos blockchain has been developed and tested, the team will be moving on to implementing the key features needed to make Stegos the number one privacy coin. We'll start by focusing on messaging, providing fully private communications for one-to-one and group chats. We'll start by adding this to the desktop wallet, but the aim is to have on-chain mobile messaging ready in January.

We'll be making a big push to moderate and reward all the wonderful content you've submitted for the social media bounty. We plan to showcase the best efforts over the next few weeks. We'll also be sharing instructions for how to complete KYC and claim your STG.

Jerry the bounty bot will be switched off when the hackathon closes on Sunday, but he'll be back very soon to provide more announcements, contests, support, and sneak previews of Stegos features under development.

## And finally...

Many thanks to everyone who has supported us on our long journey to this point. We couldn't have done it without you. We hope you'll continue to support us in our quest to reject surveillance and make the world a more free and private place.
