## Development Report July 1st – July 15th
Hello, and welcome to the Stegos Development report for our 20th Sprint, covering the period from July 1st through July 15th.

The entire development team has been firing on all pistons in preparation for the launch of our mainnet. With the launch just a few weeks away, most of our hard work has been geared towards testing the blockchain and putting finishing touches to the Stegos app.

App improvements

We’ve added several features to the Stegos wallet app, including support for multiple accounts within a single wallet. We’ve also implemented transaction history and transaction status tracking to make sending and receive STG a breeze.

Verifiable delay functions

Verifiable delay functions (VDFs) have been added to the blockchain core code. VDFs make block times more predictable, which is particularly important in the early stages of our chain when usage patterns are likely to be irregular. Keeping block times stable will help us to manage the annual inflation of STG tokens.

Stress testing

It’s important to check that the Stegos blockchain is robust before we launch. Using an automated transaction generator, we stress-tested all the vital blockchain subsystems to ensure they can handle heavy transaction loads.

Upcoming Tasks

Sprint 21 will hopefully be the final sprint before the mainnet launch. We’ll be continuing with stress testing and adding more VDFs, including replacing Hashcash in the network authorization protocol.

We’ll also be putting the finishing touches to the wallet app, to ensure that everyone has a smooth experience with Stegos right out of the gate.

As always, if you want to help with testing, contact us in the Telegram group to request some test tokens.
