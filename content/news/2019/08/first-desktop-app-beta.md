### Dear Stegos Community,
We’re excited to present the first version of the Stegos desktop app. Our development team have poured their hearts into making this, and now we’d love for you to help us test it. Please download the app and use the test STG faucet to get some test STG to put it through its paces!
​
This is the very first public version of the app, so it’s still a work in progress. But all the main features have been implemented:

- Installing the desktop app automatically installs a Stegos node and syncs with the Stegos blockchain.

- You can create, edit, delete and back up multiple Stegos accounts.

- You can send and receive test STG via the Stegos blockchain.

- You can send fully private messages via the comment function of STG transactions. (The full chat feature is coming in a future update.)

- You can request a payment certificate for a transaction and verify a payment certificate on the blockchain.

​We’re hoping to create the most intuitive and user-friendly privacy coin wallet. But we need your help to do it!<br>

Please send any feedback, suggestions, or information about bugs to the development team at <support@stegos.zendesk.com>. No comment is too small!<br>

The beta app is ready for Mac and Linux. The Windows version is still a work in progress since the node has yet to be ported. We will release the Windows version very soon.

Thanks for your help!

The Stegos Team

Send it a direct message in Telegram in the following format: /get \<your STG wallet address>

The bot will now send you 1000 STG. The Stegos blockchain is fast, so it should arrive in your Stegos account in just a few seconds!
