## Dear Community,

First of all, I'd like to apologize for the lack of updates: when you're as serious about privacy as we are at Stegos, it can be hard to strike the right balance between secrecy and sharing!
Rest assured, the whole team has been working hard behind the scenes on the Stegos chain, app, and a LOT of new marketing content, but I haven't done a good enough job of keeping you, our loyal community, up to date.
That changes now.

Starting from today, we'll be making regular weekly announcements about our progress across every aspect of Stegos, not just the technical details of our blockchain development (although of course those will continue as well).

But I promised you a surprise announcement, didn't I? Don't worry, it's not just the fact that we've been too quiet about our progress (that's not news to anyone...).
Here goes...

We're now in the home stretch of our launch and ironing out the details of public sale. It's taken longer than we'd like to get everything perfect, and so in recognition of everyone's patience and loyalty I've decided that…
…drumroll please…
…everyone who already invested in our earlier private sale rounds will receive DOUBLE TOKENS.
That means when our mainnet launches everyone will receive twice as many tokens as they thought.*
So when will the launch be? I know there’s nothing worse in crypto than hearing “soon”, so I won’t say that. But we do still have a few legal and technical hurdles to clear which are being resolved in the next few week.
Next week I’ll be holding an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session where I’ll be answering all your burning questions about mainnet, this double token reward, and more. Details to be confirmed very soon, so start thinking about what you want to ask!
What else?

Finally, we've been planning something extremely exciting on the community and marketing side. It’s something which has never been tried before in crypto and we're sure you're going to love it. I know I promised we’d be sharing more information from now on, but this is so awesome I'm going to enjoy the feeling of keeping you in suspense for just a few weeks more... (But keep a close watch on our [Telegram Channel](https://stg.to/tgn) and you might get some hints…)
I’ll be in touch again soon with the details of the AMA and the next steps for claiming your double tokens.
Until then,
Joel

*Conditions apply: This offer doesn't apply to tokens bought during the seed round. Also, I’d hoped to be able to give out this double token surprise automatically, but unfortunately the lawyers say we’ll need to sign new contracts to confirm it. But I’ll be in touch about that separately. For now let’s just savor the moment.
