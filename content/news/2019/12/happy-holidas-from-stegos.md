# Dear community,

From our Stegos family to yours, we wish you happiness and peace this holiday season!

Regardless of what you celebrate, we hope you get some private time to relax and spend time with friends and family as the year comes to an end.

## News Rundown

The end of the year has been extremely busy at Stegos HQ. Here’s some of the things you might have missed:

## Mainnet Launch

The Stegos mainnet launched in November, and everything went very smoothly, thanks to all the bug testing and feedback from the community during the hackathon. The chain is still very young, but it’s been running stably and efficiently.You can download the latest version of the Stegos wallet [here](https://github.com/stegos/stegos-wallet/releases). Try it out if you haven’t already!

### Investor Tokens Sent

As of December 23rd, all investor tokens and bonus tokens have been sent out via the blockchain. There is no token lockup, so everyone is free to start staking and earning right away! In fact, this early stage offers great opportunities for staking. The block rewards are plentiful, and the validator service award has pushed 1 million STG, just waiting for one lucky node to be selected!More tutorials and guides for staking will be coming in the New Year.

### $200,000 Bounty and Hackathon

October and November were dominated by our social media bounty and testnet hackathon, with thousands of users creating and sharing great content and putting the Stegos blockchain through its paces. Congratulations to all our winners, particularly @numig who won the 100,000 STG top prize!The hackathon prizes have all been sent out, but if you missed the boat there are still a few days to get in touch with our admins in the Stegos Telegram group.Vyper claims are still open until Friday 27th. Check if you’re a winner [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_4JZJfz4dcLDlN4qAu2Za2xlbKYxnd9yoCWWYK6vac/edit#gid=0). We’ll be showcasing the best content produced during the bounty over the coming weeks.

## Looking Ahead

It may be the holidays, but we’re continuing to work to build our network and apps to broaden the reach of Stegos and drive real-world adoption. Launching mainnet was our huge milestone, and with that out of the way, here are a few of the items on our development roadmap which are all due to be completed in the next few months:

- Staking pools, so anyone can stake their STG
- Stegos mobile app with fully private chat
- Block explorer with staking data
- Exchange listings
- A relaunch of our popular bot, Jerry, with more features and interactivity

Look out for more information on all these developments and more early next year.

### Emphasizing Exposure

In addition to these upcoming developments, we’ve developed a comprehensive marketing approach to help build awareness and expand our community as we work to make Stegos the go-to solution for end-to-end privacy for users everywhere.

We haven’t always done the best job of keeping everyone informed of major project developments, but that changes now! You’ll be seeing much more Stegos activity across our social media accounts and through our Medium blog. We’re taking advantage of every avenue to put Stegos on everyone’s radar.

But to succeed, **we need your help.** We’re a small team, and our greatest asset is you, the community. For our strategy to succeed, we need our community to engage with our content: with likes, reposts, and shares.

We understand that you all want to see Stegos grow and succeed as much as we do. Together, we can achieve our shared dream of a revolutionary network that keeps everyone safe from surveillance and provides the privacy and freedom we all deserve.

### And Finally...

We’d like to thank everyone who has stuck with Stegos through our journey thus far. You know as well as we do that we’ve had a lot of ups and downs in the past two years, and we wouldn’t be in the position we are today without the unwavering support from our community.

So, to our community, whether you’ve just joined are followed the project from the start: **Thank you.** Thank you for your engagement, enthusiasm, and patience. Once again, thank you.

**The Stegos Team**
